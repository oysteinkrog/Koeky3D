This example demonstrates how to implement animations using the Koeky 3D framework.
It is important to note tough that animations are somewhat new to me as well, so if you have any feedback: I would love to hear it.

Also: animation blending is supported, but it could use some serious tweaking.
And lastly: I believe the performance could do with improvements.

This example uses the milkshape model loader from the previous example.
